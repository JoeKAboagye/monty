# Monty

Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

This project was built by Michael Davis and Joseph Aboagye

# Brainfuck

Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller, and is notable for its extreme minimalism.

This repository includes 4 files with Brainfuck implementations.

- A Brainf*ck script that prints Holberton, followed by a new line.
- Add two digits given by the user.
- Multiply two digits given by the user.
- Multiply two digits given by the user + print a new line at the end.
